; When something changes, it would be nice to make changes in just one place
; With this in mind, I would say
; When new types are often added, message-passing-style is better
; - Because the entire type definition can be seen as one module in the source code
; When new operations are often added, data-directed-style is better
; - Because the operation (for all the types) can be kept in one module as a whole

; These are reasons from a developing/maintaining point of view, since ultimately both
; options do "the same"
